TWITTER DATA ANALYTICS

Data analytics enables both prediction and knowledge discovery capabilities. It helps in understanding the current state of the business or any process and provides a solid foundation to predict future outcomes. It has made a huge impact in the industry in terms of growth and providing optimal solutions.

A very well-known social media platform, Twitter has become a platform for many people to express their views for a particular topic. 

Now, imagine analysing data from twitter platform. If used in the right way, KNOWLEDGE can be extracted from this pile of data and hence one can arrive for better optimal solutions, be it in any field.

This project mainly focuses on analysing the data in different ways using different methods and create some functions which give us knowledge about the data.

When python programming language with its libraries is integrated with machine learning algorithms, this work becomes even more easier.

Hence, using python as the language to code, machine learning algorithms and the Twitter API, this mini project provides a platform which gives an insight of the data analysed. Some of the functionalities of the project include sentiment analysis, analysing the data, visualising the data, etc.
